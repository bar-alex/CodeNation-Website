        <p>
            I enjoy reading technical and science articles, blogs, listen to podcasts, related news, keeping on top of new discoveries and inventions.
            Programming is a passion, designing is an aspiration and building stuff (DIY) is a very useful hobby. If I'm not fiddling with something, 
            I'm probably on youtube watching a video about how something is made or how to build something, and that applies for coding as well.
            <br>Lately, I spend a lot on time on trying to understand <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">flutter</a> and how some of the coolest UIs are made within it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another passion I have is electronics. Again, building stuff, <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank">Raspberry PI</a>.
            <br>Unfortunately, I didn't had much time for them lately, but believe me, you can make some really great stuff with them. Nothing beats building something that flashes, chirps and moves around according to your commands. 
            <br>The best stuff? They are programmable, so you can build them, then write a program to have them do stuff. And then just change the program to have them do other stuff. How cool is that?
        </p>
        <p> 
            At CodeNation, I've built the_Game with 3 other colleagues and it was a great experience. I haven't actually worked with a team of coders before 
            so I really enjoyed the experience. This a great lesson for me as it showed me some areas where I laked and others I could improve on.
