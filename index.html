        <h1> the_Game </h1>
        <p>"the_Game" is a python project we have completed during our python coding curse at CodeNation. 
        <br>It's a text based game, with D&D style battle system (dice rolls), rpg elements, inventory system, random encounters and loot drops, where you have to go and kill each type of monster from the available list, in order to win. It also features colorized ascii art graphics (from public domain, credit in ascii art was kept where present).
        <br>Be mindful though "the_Game" was built on the span of a few days, by students trying to understand python and how it works. So even if there are no game-breaking bugs as we know, unexpected stuff might still happen. At some point, changes could be made and an update notice will be placed on this website when that happens.</p>
        
        <div class="story">
        <p>The story of the game sees you in front of the king, who is feeling old and feeble and is worried about it's kingdom as it has no male hairs to take over his crown. Having this situation on his hands, he decides to let everyone who whishes the crown to go forth and kill one creature of each type, including the boss of the game, a mighty dragon called Drogo.
        <br><br>
        As it happens, the kingdom is conveniently surrounded by a forest where all the creatures are to be found, a magical forest, where up, down, left and right have no real meaning, and you aimlessly wander about and looking for, and fighting any creature that you encounter. Occasionally you encounter an event that you have to deal with - some or good, some or not.
        <br><br>
        As with any good rpg game, you have a set of stats (HP, ATK, DEF) that influences your battles and available options, items that you equip (Weapon, Armor) and maybe a couple of items you can make use of, for special actions. And they can be found at event sites, or dropped by defeated monsters.
